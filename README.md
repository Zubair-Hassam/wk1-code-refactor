# wk1-code-refactor
This weeks homework entailed a website that is build for a marketing agency that needed to be debugged to an extent. Whilst the code was functional and worked, it was a bit messy and needed to cleaned up for efficinecy sake. 

The index.html file included is well structured but is missing certain features such as an alternative backup in the case that certain images become corrupt. Certain headings in the structure are also vague and not coherent with what they represrnt on the website. The primary title is also vague and needs to be renamed to give it a unqie tab name. 

The style.css sheet is build well enough that it is able to carry out the design fucntions required. However, the order of logic is not as efficient as it could be. Thus, the order of code written is re-ordered in a manner where "universal" code preceeds "elemnt" code which preceeds "class" code which preceeds "ID" code. 

# The User Story 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# The Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
